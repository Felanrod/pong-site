					<em>About Us</em>&quest; More like &ldquo;About Me&excl;&rdquo; I, Joel Murphy, am a visionary, a prophet, and the best salesman in the world. That&apos;s why <img id="atari" src="../images/atari.png" title="Atari Inc." alt="Atari Inc." width="60" height="15"/> is paying me literally thousands of dollars to sell you these futuristic electronic entertainment boxes, and because I can create a website like we have in the future, after the creation of the internet. I&apos;m already filthy rich, but you can never have too much money.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you actually wanted to know about the company that created <em>Pong</em> I guess I could give you some information on them. <em>Atari Inc.</em> was founded by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney, and has only been around for a couple of years. Before <em>Pong</em> the pair made a game called <em>Computer Space</em>, which really wasn&apos;t that great, but then Allan Acorn was hired on and created the masterpiece I offer you today.
				</p>
				<p>
					In a few years the company will create one of the most iconic and influential electronic entertainment machines ever&excl; The <em>Atari 2600</em>. This video game console will be able to play a multitude of popular <em>Atari Inc.</em> games. Unfortunately, due to competitors and price wars they will eventually lose all the success they will gain, not before putting out the Atari 5200, which will be not that great.
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite their fall from the video game console market they will come back in the further future and keep making the actual video games for the leading consoles&hellip; OF THE FUTURE&excl;&excl;
				</p>
				<p>
					They don&apos;t have a website in this century, but here is their website in the future <a id="atari_site" href="www.atari.com" title="www.atari.com">www.atari.com</a>
