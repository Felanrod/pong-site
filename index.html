						With their revolutionary technology, the brand new interactive electronic entertainment company, <em>Atari Inc.</em> has created an arcade hit that is sweeping the continent&excl; The ping&ndash;pong simulator allows you to direct a <em>virtual</em> paddle, with a radial dial, up and down a screen while you try to keep the ball &#40;also <em>virtual</em>&#41; from going past your paddle. I know what you&apos;re thinking&#58; <q>Joel, how are you so good looking <em>and</em> smart&quest;</q> That&apos;s one of life&apos;s great mysteries, dear reader. What you should be asking is&#58; <q>How is it possible to play by yourself if no one is controlling the other paddle&quest;</q> That&apos;s what the geniuses, not unlike myself, at <em>Atari Inc.</em> have figured out. For single player games an <q>artificial intelligence,</q> or AI, has been programmed into the system. In a sense it&apos;s as if the machine has a mind of its own, with its ability to move the paddle and block the incoming ball. If machines can competitively go aginst a human at ping&ndash;pong, imagine what else they can do&hellip;

						Already a hit in the ten most important states, and three most important provinces, <em>Pong</em> is ready to become a staple of your daily life.
