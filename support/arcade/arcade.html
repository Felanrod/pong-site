							<div id="faq2">
								<p>
									Q: Where&apos;s my arcade version&quest; It&apos;s been ten weeks since I paid.
								</p>
								<p>
									A: Haven&apos;t you ever heard that patience is a virtue&quest; It is a very long process to make them and with your extremely large order, they want the products to get to your house all at the same time.
								</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<div id="faq3">
								<p>
									Q: I only ordered one though.

						<li>
							<div id="faq4">
								<p>
									Q: Will anyone help me bring it into my house&quest;
								</p>
								<p>
									A: You get what you pay for. If you had of dished out the extra &#36;200.00 it would have come in a conveniently mobile case. Too bad&excl;

							<div id="faq5">
								<p>
									Q: Can I return it and pay the extra for the smaller version&quest;
								</p>
								<p>
									A: Nope, no refunds whatsoever. It is clearly stated in the fine print on the Purchase page. It&apos;s really fine print so you&apos;ll have to bang your head off of the screen to even try to see it.

							<div id="faq6">
								<p>
									Q: Why is it taking so long to get if I only ordered one&quest;
								</p>
								<p>
									A: Great. It&apos;s you again&hellip; Well they are actually being made by third-world slave labourers in the small country of Michigan. As you may now, it takes a long time to get across that ocean, what with all the pirates and stuff.

							<div id="faq7">
								<p>
									Q: What&apos;s wrong with it&quest;

								<p>
									Q: Why won&apos;t it let me play&quest; It keeps asking me to insert a coin.
