					<q>But Joel, I don&apos;t have room in my house for such a magnificent piece of revolutionary technology and it makes me so sad that I wish to end my life if I can&apos;t have <em>Pong</em>.</q>

            	<p>
					I feel your pain. Not long ago I found myself going through the exact same thing you are now. <q>Where would I fit that marvelous machine in my mansion&quest; My ferraris are taking up all 17 thousand square feet&excl;</q> Well my fellow mansion owning friend, you shall fret no more. The fine folks at <img id="atari" src="../images/atari.png" title="Atari Inc." alt="Atari Inc." width="60" height="15"/> have actually created a smaller version of <em>Pong</em> that has no screen.

					<q>No screen&quest; But how will I ever enjoy hundreds of hours of entertainment a week if I can&apos;t see what I&apos;m doing&quest;</q> There is a simple answer to that&hellip; You connect it to one of your many television sets, of course. Although televisions don&apos;t have any accessible inputs for this new creation, it is as simple as flying a spaceship. All you have to do is remove the backing of your entertainment tube, splice the wire provided from the machine and solder them to the viewing connections. You will want to leave your television on so you can tell when you connect to the right pieces of metal. Electrocution is virtually not even there&hellip; a little.
